# Course Title : Software Engineering 
## Course Code : CSE 305
## Project Proposal : A Recipe and Health Management System
This model is helpful for the people who are confused about making recipe.Sometimes we become puzzeled that we have some food ingredients but we do not know how to use it or what recipe can be maked by them,This model will help to make recipe and also will help to maintain good food habit.

### Applied Waterfall SDLC Model :

## Here are some reasons why  might choose to use the Waterfall model for such a project:

### 1.Requirements 
- The user will give food ingridients as input ,the software will provide recipe
- The user will give  number of people as input ,the software will give total amount of ingridients required
- The user will give health issues and ingridients as input,the software will identify the  ingridients are suitable or not for him /her.
- The user will give ingridients and the software will provide the amount of calorie he/she will gain .
- Software will give previous recipe history and health record

### 2.Design
#### User interface Design

- Created a userfree user interface

#### System architecture design
- Using class diagram designed a System Architecture design

#### Database design
- For keep track of the records of the recipe and health issues used a database and the database is designed by class diagram
### 3.Development
#### Coding
- Used vs code for coding
- Used java programming language
- Used oop concept,functions and java fx

#### Database Implementation
- Used database for storing data 
### 4. Testing 
### Unit Testing:
-	Verify that each component works properly in the project.
-	Address any issues identified during unit testing.
#### Integration Testing:
-	Test the interaction between different modules to ensure they function together faultlessly.
-	Detect and fix any integration issues.
#### User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
-	Involve end-users to test the system in a simulated real-world environment.
-	Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### 5.Deployment
#### Installation:
- installed vs code
- installed mysql

### 6.Maintanance
#### Bug Fixes:
-	Address any issues or bugs reported by usersâ€™ post-deployment.
-	Implement patches or updates as needed.
